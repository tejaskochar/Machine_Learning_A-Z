A Regional Manager wants to join our firm. He has a experience of years of being a regional manager in his last firm and he demands his salary should be more then 160K, as his last firm used to give hime that amount.
As a data scientist, you are givrn the task to analyse if this amount is true and if he should be given this salary. You are given a set of salaries of the firm in question and it usually takes 4 years to make a Partner for a regional manager!
